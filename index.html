        <h4>What is Version Control System (VCS)?</h4>
        <p>Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software projectâ€™s code. As a software project
            grows, version control becomes essential.</p>
        <p>
            Version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.

            With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can
            then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.

            Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code
            back into the main source code to make it official.

            All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Git?</h4>
        <p>
            Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git is software that runs locally. Your files and
            their
            history are stored on your computer. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a
            record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also
            makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

            So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be
            useful for you.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Github?</h4>
        <p>GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it
            makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.</p>
        <h4>Git & Github</h4>
        <p>Git and Github are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool.
            GitHub is a company that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need GitHub to use
            git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">There are many ways to use git including command line and
            git gui. We will work on git using commands in this tutorial</div>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">Whenever I mention <strong>run command</strong>, it means running the specified
            command in <strong>Terminal</strong> (Linux, Mac) or <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (Windows)</div>
        <h4>Step 0: Install and Setup Git, Create Github Account</h4>
        <div class="step-details mx-3">
            <p>First of all you need to <a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank">create Github account</a>
                and <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank">install
                    git</a> on your operating system.
            </p>
            <p>If git is installed, running the command <code>git --version</code> will output git version</p>
            <p>Now you need to add your name and email in git configuration. Run these commands.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>git config --global user.name &ltYour Name&gt</code>
                    <p>Replace &ltYour Name&gt with your actual name. In my case, it will become
                        <i style="color: green;">git config --global user.name Usman</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>git config --global user.email &ltGithub Email&gt</code>
                    <p>Replace &ltGithub Email&gt with your email which you used to sign up for Github. It will be like
                        <i style="color: green;">git config --global user.email abc@email.com</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Run these commands to verify if name and email are added.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>git config --global user.name</code>
                    <p>This will output the name you added</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>git config --global user.email</code>
                    <p>This will output the email you added</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
