        <h4>What is Version Control System (VCS)?</h4>
        <p>Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software projectâ€™s code. As a software project
            grows, version control becomes essential.</p>
        <p>
            Version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.

            With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can
            then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.

            Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code
            back into the main source code to make it official.

            All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Git?</h4>
        <p>
            Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git is software that runs locally. Your files and
            their
            history are stored on your computer. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a
            record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also
            makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

            So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be
            useful for you.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Github?</h4>
        <p>GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it
            makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.</p>
        <h4>Git & Github</h4>
        <p>Git and Github are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool.
            GitHub is a company that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need GitHub to use
            git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">There are many ways to use git including command line and
            git gui. We will work on git using commands in this tutorial. Also i'll be using Linux environment. I assume
            you are aware of some basic Linux commands e.g creating file, writing to file, creating directory,
            displaying contents of a
            directory etc.</div>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">Whenever I mention <strong>run command</strong>, it means running the specified
            command in <strong>Terminal</strong> (Linux, Mac) or <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (Windows)</div>
        <h4>Step 0: Install and Setup Git, Create Github Account</h4>
        <div class="step-details mx-3">
            <p>First of all you need to <a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank">create Github account</a>
                and <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank">install
                    git</a> on your operating system.
            </p>
            <p>If git is installed, running the command <code>git --version</code> will output git version</p>
            <p>Now you need to add your name and email in git configuration. Run these commands.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>git config --global user.name &ltYour Name&gt</code>
                    <p>Replace &ltYour Name&gt with your actual name. In my case, it will become
                        <i style="color: green;">git config --global user.name Usman</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>git config --global user.email &ltGithub Email&gt</code>
                    <p>Replace &ltGithub Email&gt with your email which you used to sign up for Github. It will be like
                        <i style="color: green;">git config --global user.email abc@email.com</i>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Run these commands to verify if name and email are added.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>git config --global user.name</code>
                    <p>This will output the name you added</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>git config --global user.email</code>
                    <p>This will output the email you added</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Step 1: Create Local Repository</h4>
        <div class="step-details mx-3">
            <p>Create a new directory where you want to place your project files and set this directory as current
                working directory in your Terminal or Command Prompt.</p>
            <p>Run the command <code>git init</code>. After
                running the command, an empty repository will be created locally in your current directory.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/gitinit.png">
            <p>This repository will be represented by <strong>.git</strong> directory which is hidden. We can also work
                in branches in git, by default there will be one branch created named <strong>master</strong>. Tradition
                is that your master branch should contain only fully working tested code. If you need to add new
                features or update your code, create a new branch, work on it, when you're sure that this code is now
                error free and fully working, merge this new branch to master.</p>
            <p>Creating and merging branches are explained later.</p>
            <p>We will use plain text files for this tutorial. Add some files in current working directory, let's say
                <strong>file1.txt</strong>,
                <strong>file2.txt</strong>. Also create another folder here and add <strong>file3.txt</strong> in it.
                Add some text in these files.
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/images/addfiles.png">
            <p>File contents are:</p>
            <p><strong>file1.txt: </strong>This is file 1</p>
            <p><strong>file2.txt: </strong>This is file 2</p>
            <p><strong>InsideFolder/file3.txt: </strong>This is file 3</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Step 2: Add & Commit Files (Staging)</h4>
        <div class="step-details mx-3">
            <p>Till now, we have empty repository and we have some files in our working directory. To work
                correctly, local repository need to track the files so git can know the histroy of these files.</p>
            <p>So we need to add these files to this repository. Running the command <code>git status</code> will tell
                you the details of files which are not added to the repository or which files are new or updated.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/gitstatus1.png">
            <p>You can see, this command is telling which branch you're currently on and there are some untracked files
                and directories. We need our repository to track these files. If you want to add all files at once, run
                the
                command <code>git add .</code> (dot at the end). If don't want to add all files, you can also add files
                explicitly by running the command <code>git add &ltfilename&gt</code>
            </p>
            <p>Replace filename with file you want to add. We can also add multiple files with this command. This
                command will be like <i style="color: green;">git add file1.txt</i> or if adding multiple files <i
                    style="color: green;">git add
                    file1.txt file2.txt</i></p>
            <p>Let's say we add <strong>file1.txt</strong>. After adding, check the status of git.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/gitstatus2.png">
            <p>You can see it is telling us that there is new file and there are still two untracked files. It is upto
                us if we wan't to include these remaining files also or not, there is no restriction. Let us add all
                files and then check git status.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/gitstatus3.png">
            <p><strong>In git context, adding files is technically known as STAGING.</strong></p>
            <p>If for any reason, you don't want to add file (unstage), but you already did it, running command
                <code>git rm --cached &ltfilename&gt</code> will unstage file for you.
            </p>
            <p>Replace &ltfilename&gt with the file you want to unstage. This command will be like <i
                    style="color: green;">git rm --cached file2.txt</i>. Let us test this command.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/unstage.png">
            <p>You can see that file is unstaged. Add this file again.</p>
            <p>We're all well aware of <strong>save</strong>. Everytime we save our work so that the work done should
                not lost.</p>
            <p>This is what we want to do here. We want to save our work but working with git, we say
                <strong>commit</strong> our work. There is a command which will do this work for you.
            </p>
            <code>git commit -m "&ltMessage&gt"</code>
            <p>Replace the &ltMessage&gt with descriptive message, what you've done before this commit.</p>
            <p>This command will be like <i style="color: green;">git commit -m "This is my very first commit. I am
                    still learning. I added three text files to practice."</i></p>
            <img src="./assets/images/commit.png" style="width: 100%;">
            <div class="alert alert-info">Everytime there is new file, deletion of file or there is updation to file, we
                need to add it. Commit is obviously necessary after ebery change.
